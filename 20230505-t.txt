Torah means 'instruction.' Made of historical narratives and law. 
Nevi'im - Prophets/Last;prophet is Malachi BCE. Nehimiah and Ezra collaborated to make the Torah written law, so no more prophets are needed.

Prophecy in biblical sense is more of a realistic, yet moral summation based on actions. Not so much as "crytal ball gazing". Very poetic.
